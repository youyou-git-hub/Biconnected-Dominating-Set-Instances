# Biconnected-Dominating-Set-Instances
We generated a new random dataset for the future comparison. It is generated based on a random distribution rule, where v vertices are randomly distributed on a two-dimensional coordinate system with both x and y coordinates ranging from 0 to 100. If the distance between two vertices is less than d, they are considered to be connected by an edge. The dataset contains 20 instances, including two small-scale ones with obvious special k values, and 18 large-scale ones with v values of 300, 400, and 500, and d values of 5%, 10%, 20%, 30%, 50%, and 70%. The first number in the first row of the dataset represents the number of nodes, and the second number represents the number of edges. Each subsequent row represents the presence of an edge between two nodes.
